##Technical knowledge for QA
###What is a specification?
A specification is a  description of a component’s function or 
a description of a feature in terms of its output values for specified input values under specified conditions,

###What is a test plan?
The test plan is the Documentation describing the test objectives to be achieved and the means and the schedule for achieving them, organized to coordinate testing activities.

###What is a test case?
A test case is a set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected results and postconditions, developed based on test conditions.

###What is a bug?
A bug or defect is An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications.

###What is the purpose of a bug report? 
The purpose of the bug report is the Documentation of the occurrence, nature, and status of a defect in order to reproduce and correct it.


###What are the parts of a bug report?
a bug report includes in my opinion 4 part: the input values or precondition, the description or the scenarios, the expected results and the results obtained

###What is unit, functional, integration, regression, black/white box, acceptance testing?

**Unit Testing** is the testing of individual software components.

**functional testing** is the Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a component or system with functional requirements.

**integration testing** is a Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the interactions between integrated components or systems.

**Regression testing** is a Testing of a previously tested program following modification to ensure that defects have not been introduced or uncovered in unchanged areas of the software, as a result of the changes made.

**The white box testing** is a Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.

**The black box testing**  is a Testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing

**Acceptance testing** is the Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system.
